● Built an algorithm, for generating a random tile world, upon starting a new game, with different size rooms connected by
hallways.
● Implemented an interactive, Main Menu UI, with features to play and save a game and load a previously saved game.
● Built a graph of the world and implemented a shortest path algorithm, allowing the player to search for the shortest route
to any point in the world.
